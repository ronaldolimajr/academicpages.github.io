I am a Brazilian linguist currently working as a Professor in the Department of Linguistics, Portuguese and Classical Languages at the [University of Brasília](https://www.unb.br){:target="_blank"}, in Brazil, working with Brazilian Portuguese as a Second Language.

My previous job was as a Professor of Phonetics and Phonology in the Department of English Language Studies at the [Federal University of Ceará](https://www.ufc.br){:target="_blank"}, in Brazil, from 2014 through 2023.

I have co-founded the Laboratory of Phonetics and Multilingualism ([LabPhoM](https://labfom.ufc.br/){:target="_blank"}), and  my main research interests are in the phonetic-phonological development of non-native languages, especially using the tools of acoustic phonetics, and in quantitative data analysis.

At the moment I am working on a project to analyze the rhythm of Portguese, Spanish and English from a Coupled-Oscillator perspective. I am also working on the first of a possible three-book project on quantitative data analysis for linguists, to be published in Portuguese.

I am a Brazilian linguist currently working as a Professor of Phonetics and Phonology in the Department of English Language Studies at the [Federal University of Ceará](https://www.ufc.br){:target="_blank"}, in Brazil.

I have co-founded and currently direct the Laboratory of Phonetics and Multilingualism ([LabPhoM](https://labfom.ufc.br/){:target="_blank"}), and  my main research interests are in the phonetic-phonological development of non-native languages, especially using the tools of acoustic phonetics, and in quantitative data analysis.

At the moment I am working on a longitudinal project analyzing the development of the rhythm of English by Brazilian college learners of English Language Teaching. I am also working on a tutorial-style book (possibly to be published in an ebook format) on longitudinal analysis of linguistic data, through (Bayesian) hierarchical models.
